        <content>
            Spotahome is proud to present a newly constructed student residence hall offering five types of rooms, studios, and apartments, all complete with ensuite bathrooms and brand new furniture. This residence, located in the heart of central London in the Camden neighborhood, is a perfect choice for those studying in this buzzing international city. Designed by award-winning architects with comfort in mind, each type comes with its own bathroom in addition to a built-in wardrobe, desk, and heating unit. There are five room and apartment types with differing amenities and size, but each offers top-of-the-line amenities to ensure that tenants have the best stay possible. Common areas include the lounge area featuring a kitchen, laundry room, meeting area, study room, and a 24/7 gym. The surrounding area, Camden, is a central and eclectic area with a lively nightlife and urban culture. As there are several universities located in the neighborhood, Camden maintains a young and student-friendly atmosphere with excellent connections to other parts of London and Europe via the underground, bus, and light rail.
